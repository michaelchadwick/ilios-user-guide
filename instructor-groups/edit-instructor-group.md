## Remove Instructor Group

If the trash can icon is enabled as it is in the screen shot above, the instrutor group can be deleted / removed from the system. This occurs because this Instructor Group has not been associated with any teaching activities. The "Associated Courses" field, the count of which gets updated when this instructor group is used in session offerings or ILM's, provides this information. If that number is greater than zero, the trash can delete button will be disabled.

## Sort Options

The instructor group listing can be sorted by either "Instructor Group Title" - the default sort order (A-Z) or by "Associated Courses", which can be useful when you would like to review the instructor groups with more usage in courses and sessions.

## Associated Courses 

This includes sessions and links to the referenced sessions. This will take the usage to Courses and Sessions to perform any maintenance or review of the session and its offerings.

An example of this, showing a different insttuctor group with "Associated Courses" in expanded mode, is shown below.
